We propose to create Resilience at Yale — “R@Y”— a data-driven, scalable and sustainable infrastructure for
resilience training and wellness activities at the Yale School of Medicine (YSM) for students and faculty from
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities and from socially, culturally,
economically or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Using validated resilience and psychological
wellness scales in a survey instrument, we aim to measure the resilience and ascertain the needs of MD-PhD
students, PhD students and faculty participating in NIGMS-funded T32 training grants at YSM in the context of
the laboratory research environment. Data from this study will inform the second aim to create a strong
infrastructure staffed by administrators, mental health professionals, faculty and student peers to implement
existing NIH Office of Intramural Training and Education Resilience Training Program curricula and training
activities (webinars, small group discussions, peer ambassador training) developed by Dr. Sharon Milgram and

The ability to understand disease processes and translate this knowledge into innovative and effective
approaches to ameliorate disease can be best provided by individuals formally trained in both in basic
science and clinical medicine. Furthermore, there is a need for more clinicians with epidemiology training
who are able to understand and evaluate the incidence, distribution and determinants of health and disease
in populations, as well as assess the impact of treatments and healthcare policy. Thus, the goal of the MD-

Thus, students dedicated to this career path should be nurtured and placed in training environments such as the Ohio State University that will enable them to reach these lofty goals. Continued NIGMS support of this training is essential to providing the environment that will allow these future physician-scientist leaders to flourish.","NIGMS","10200536","6/26/2020 12:00:00 AM","PA-14-015","3T32GM075787-10S1","3","T32","GM","075787","10","S","GINDHART, JOSEPH G","6/1/2006 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2021 12:00:00 AM","Training and Workforce Development Study Section - A[TWD-A]"," ","1928269","KIRSCHNER, LAWRENCE S","Not Applicable","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","832127323","DLWBSLWAJWR1","832127323","DLWBSLWAJWR1","US","40.003166","-83.034278","6218701","OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","COLUMBUS","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","432101016","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2021 12:00:00 AM","859","Training, Institutional","2020"," "," ","NIMH","48917","2386"," ","51303",

The ability to understand disease processes and translate this knowledge into innovative and effective
approaches to ameliorate disease can be best provided by individuals formally trained in both in basic
science and clinical medicine. Furthermore, there is a need for more clinicians with epidemiology training
who are able to understand and evaluate the incidence, distribution and determinants of health and disease
in populations, as well as assess the impact of treatments and healthcare policy. Thus, the goal of the MD-

"Clinical Research","Medical;Scientist;Training Programs","Medical Scientist Training Program"," This program produces physician scientists who have both MD and PhD training, i.e., who receive both degrees at the completion of the program. MD-PhD graduates have deeper perceptions of medical significance in biology than do scientists without medical education, more comprehensive understanding of the limitations in medical practice, and greater ability to transfer basic scientific advances toward patient care advances. Thus, MD-PhD graduates are positioned to identify and pursue interdisciplinary approaches to important biomedical problems, and to help bridge the basic and clinical sciences.

"Clinical Research","Medical;Scientist;Training Programs","Medical Scientist Training Program","  The relevance of physician scientist training programs is the recognition of the fundamental importance of interdisciplinary research and training in both clinical medical sciences and disease pathology and the elucidation of disease mechanisms through basic research. It has become apparent that the traditional segregation of analytical approaches to solving biomedically relevant problems is most fertile when integrated analyses involving diverse technologies across multiple disciplines occur. The Emory MSTP is perfectly situated to engage such a diverse training philosophy and has a long history of doing so.

"No NIH Category available","Medical;Ohio;Scientist;Training Programs;Universities","Medical Scientist Training Program - Ohio State University"," The mission of all NIH-funded research is the improvement of this nation's health. Since MD-PhD trainees have expertise in the continuum of basic science to clinical application, they have the optimal skill set to discover fundamental disease mechanisms and to bring these findings back to the clinic. Thus, students dedicated to pursuing this career path should be nurtured and placed in training environments such as the Ohio State University that will enable them to reach these lofty goals. NIGMS support of this training is essential in providing the environment that will allow these future physician-scientist leaders to flourish.

"No NIH Category available","Medical;Ohio;Scientist;Training Programs;Universities","Medical Scientist Training Program - Ohio State University"," The mission of all NIH-funded research is the improvement of this nation's health. Since MD-PhD trainees have expertise in the continuum of basic science to clinical application, they have the optimal skill set to discover fundamental disease mechanisms and to bring these findings back to the clinic. Thus, students dedicated to pursuing this career path should be nurtured and placed in training environments such as the Ohio State University that will enable them to reach these lofty goals. NIGMS support of this training is essential in providing the environment that will allow these future physician-scientist leaders to flourish.
